- 👋 Hi, I’m ELATTAR Ayoub.
- 👀 I’m interested in being a Fullstack developer. I've always wanted to be a programmer from my childhood, and now I'm trying to make my dream come true, Incha2a Allah. I'm currently learning backend development such as C# and JavaScript and Python, and then after that, when I feel myself reached a good level, I'm going to start learning Front End development such as HTML and CSS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and JavaScript and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any work that will help people even with no cash.
- 📫 How to reach me (Email: ayoubatar8@gmail.com) (Email2: bondrewd7@gmail.com) (Phone: +212 649028985) (LinkedIn: )
